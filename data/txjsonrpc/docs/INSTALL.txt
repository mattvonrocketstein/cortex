Installation
============

Development
-----------

If you want to develop for txJSON-RPC or use the latest code we're working on,
you can install from the sources. You'll need bzr installed, and then just do
the following::

    $ bzr branch lp:txjsonrpc
    $ cd txjsonrpc
    $ sudo python setup.py install


Easy Install
------------

You can use the setuptools easy_install script to get txSpore on your system::

    $ sudo easy_install txJSON-RPC


Manual Download
---------------

You can manually download the source tarball from the Python Package Index by
visiting the following URL:

    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/txJSON-RPC/

You'll need to untar and gunzip the source, cd into the source directory, and
then you can do the usual::

    $ sudo python setup.py install


Checking the Source
-------------------

Once installed, you can test the source code by executing this from the
top-level source directory::

    $ trial txjsonrpc

That will run the test suite and report on the success and failure of any unit
tests.
