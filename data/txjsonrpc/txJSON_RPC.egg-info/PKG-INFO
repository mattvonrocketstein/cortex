        ============
        Introduction
        ============
        
        txJSON-RPC allows you to create async Python JSON-RPC servers and clients
        either over HTTP or directly on TCP with the Netstring protocol. txJSON-RPC is
        written in Twisted.
        
        ========
        Features
        ========
        
        * Asynchronous JSON-RPC server and client code.
        
        * Support for HTTP and TCP (Netstring) JSON-RPC.
        
        * A jsonrpclib similar to the one for XLM-RPC offered by the Python standard
        library.
        
        
        ============
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        txJSON-RPC currently has the following dependencies:
        
        * Twisted - http://twistedmatrix.com/
        
        
        ============
        Installation
        ============
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        If you want to develop for txJSON-RPC or use the latest code we're working on,
        you can install from the sources. You'll need bzr installed, and then just do
        the following::
        
        $ bzr branch lp:txjsonrpc
        $ cd txjsonrpc
        $ sudo python setup.py install
        
        
        Easy Install
        ------------
        
        You can use the setuptools easy_install script to get txSpore on your system::
        
        $ sudo easy_install txJSON-RPC
        
        
        Manual Download
        ---------------
        
        You can manually download the source tarball from the Python Package Index by
        visiting the following URL:
        
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/txJSON-RPC/
        
        You'll need to untar and gunzip the source, cd into the source directory, and
        then you can do the usual::
        
        $ sudo python setup.py install
        
        
        Checking the Source
        -------------------
        
        Once installed, you can test the source code by executing this from the
        top-level source directory::
        
        $ trial txjsonrpc
        
        That will run the test suite and report on the success and failure of any unit
        tests.

        Usage
        =====
        
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        In the top-level source directory for txJSON-RPC, there is an examples
        directory.  This contains the following:
        
        * Client and server examples for twiste.web-based JSON-RPC.
        
        * Client and server examples for twiste.web2-based JSON-RPC.
        
        * Client and server examples for Netstring TCP JSON-RPC as well as code shoing
        how to use subhandlers for the TCP code, since this is different than the
        XML-RPC/JSON-RPC HTTP-based subhandlers.
        
        Examining each of the Python files in the example directories is the best way
        to get a sense of how to use txJSON-RPC.

        TODO
        ====
        
        Known Issues
        ------------
        
        * txJSON-RPC doesn't yet support the proposed v2.0 JSON-RPC protocol.
        
        JSON-RPC All
        ------------
        
        JSON-RPC over TCP
        -----------------
        
        * add version support in proxy constructor and callRemote method
        
        * add unit tests for proxy's use of version in constructor as well as
        callRemote
        
        * pull out anything that has to do with setting the payload (e.g.,
        method/params dict) and put it in jsonrpclib
        
        * clean up error checking, now that errors are going in the payload under the
        "error" key.
        
        
        JSON-RPC over HTTP (web2)
        --------------------------
        
        * add a client example
        
        * update
        
        
        JSON-RPC over HTTP (web)
        ------------------------
        
        * add unit tests for proxy's use of version in constructor as well as
        callRemote
        
        
        jsonrpclib
        ----------
        
        * return results in simpljson dicts with possible keeys of "result" or "error"
        
        * use simplesjon's hook for creating appropriate JS objects from hints in the
        results
