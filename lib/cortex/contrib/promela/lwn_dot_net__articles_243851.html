           <H3>Validating Parallel Algorithms</H3>

Parallel algorithms can be hard to write, and even harder to debug.
Testing, though essential, is insufficient, as fatal race conditions
can have extremely low probabilities of occurrence.
Proofs of correctness can be valuable, but in the end are just as
prone to human error as is the original algorithm.
<P>

It would be very helpful to have a tool that could somehow locate
all race conditions.
Such a tool in fact exists in the form of the language Promela
and its compiler Spin.


<H3>What are Promela and Spin?</H3>

Promela is a language designed to help verify protocols, but which
can also be used to verify small parallel algorithms.
You recode your algorithm and correctness constraints in the C-like
language Promela, and then use Spin to translate it into a C program
that you can compile and run.
The resulting program conducts a full state-space search of your
algorithm, either verifying or finding counter-examples for
assertions that you can include in your Promela program.
<P>

This full-state search can be extremely powerful, but can also be
a two-edged sword.
If your algorithm is too complex or your Promela implementation is
careless, there might be more states than fit in memory.
Furthermore, even given sufficient memory, the state-space search might
well run for longer than the expected lifetime of the universe.
Therefore, use this tool for compact but complex parallel algorithms.
Attempts to naively apply it to even moderate-scale algorithms (let alone
the full Linux kernel) will end badly.
<P>

Promela and Spin may be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://spinroot.com/spin/whatispin.html">here</A>.
<P>

The above site also gives links to Gerard Holzmann's excellent
book on Promela and Spin, as well as online references starting
<A HREF="http://www.spinroot.com/spin/Man/index.html">here</A>.
<P>

The remainder of this article describes how to use Promela to debug
parallel algorithms, starting with simple examples and progressing to
more complex uses.
<p>

<H3>Promela Example: Non-Atomic Increment</H3>
<p>

The following example demonstrates the textbook race condition
resulting from non-atomic increment:

<pre>
  1 #define NUMPROCS 2
  2 
  3 byte counter = 0;
  4 byte progress[NUMPROCS];
  5 
  6 proctype incrementer(byte me)
  7 {
  8   int temp;
  9 
 10   temp = counter;
 11   counter = temp + 1;
 12   progress[me] = 1;
 13 }
 14 
 15 init {
 16   int i = 0;
 17   int sum = 0;
 18 
 19   atomic {
 20     i = 0;
 21     do
 22     :: i &lt; NUMPROCS -&gt;
 23       progress[i] = 0;
 24       run incrementer(i);
 25       i++
 26     :: i &gt;= NUMPROCS -&gt; break
 27     od;
 28   }
 29   atomic {
 30     i = 0;
 31     sum = 0;
 32     do
 33     :: i &lt; NUMPROCS -&gt;
 34       sum = sum + progress[i];
 35       i++
 36     :: i &gt;= NUMPROCS -&gt; break
 37     od;
 38     assert(sum &lt; NUMPROCS || counter == NUMPROCS)
 39   }
 40 }
</pre>

Line 1 defines the number of processes to run (we will vary this
to see the effect on state space), line 3 defines the counter,
and line 4 is used to implement the assertion that appears on
lines 29-39.
<P>

Lines 6-13 define a process that increments the counter non-atomically.
The argument "me" is the process number, set by the initialization
block later in the code.
Because simple Promela statements are each assumed atomic, we must
break the increment into the two statements on lines 10-11.
The assignment on line 12 marks the process's completion.
Because the Spin system will fully search the state space, including
all possible sequences of states, there is no need for the loop
that would be used for conventional testing.
<P>

Lines 15-40 are the initialization block, which is executed first.
Lines 19-28 actually do the initialization, while lines 29-39
perform the assertion.
Both are atomic blocks in order to avoid unnecessarily increasing
the state space: because they are not part of the algorithm proper,
we loose no validation coverage by making them atomic.
<P>

The do-od construct on lines 21-27 implements a Promela loop,
which can be thought of as a C "<TT>for (;;)</TT>" loop containing a
"switch" statement that allows expressions in case labels.
The condition blocks (prefixed by "<TT>::</TT>")
are scanned non-deterministically,
though in this case only one of the conditions can possibly hold at a given
time.
The first block of the do-od from lines 22-25 initializes the i-th
incrementer's progress cell, runs the i-th incrementer's process, and
then increments the variable "i".
The second block of the do-od on line 26 exits the loop once
these processes have been started.
<P>

The atomic block on lines 29-39 also contains a similar do-od
loop that sums up the progress counters.
The <TT>assert()</TT> statement on line 38 verifies that if all processes
have been completed, then all counts have been correctly recorded.
<P>

You can build and run this program as follows:
<pre>
        spin -a increment.spin          # Translate the model to C
        cc -DSAFETY -o pan pan.c        # Compile the model
        ./pan                           # Run the model
</pre>

This will produce output as follows:

<pre>
        pan: assertion violated ((sum<2)||(counter==2)) (at depth 20)
        pan: wrote increment.spin.trail
        (Spin Version 4.2.5 -- 2 April 2005)

                assertion violations    +
                cycle checks            - (disabled by -DSAFETY)
                invalid end states      +

        State-vector 40 byte, depth reached 22, errors: 1

              51 atomic steps
        hash conflicts: 0 (resolved)

        2.622   memory usage (Mbyte)
</pre>

The first line tells us that our assertion was violated (as expected
given the non-atomic increment!).
The second line that a "trail" file was written describing how the
assertion was violated.
The "Warning" line reiterates that all was not well with our model.
The second paragraph describes the type of state-search being carried out,
in this case for assertion violations and invalid end states.
The third paragraph gives state-size statistics: this small model had only
45 states.
The final line shows memory usage.
<P>

The "trail" file may be rendered human-readable as follows:
<pre>
        spin -t -p increment.spin
</pre>
This gives the following output:

 21:    proc  0 (:init:) line  40 "increment.spin" (state 24) &lt;valid end state&gt;
3 processes created
</pre>

As can be seen, the first portion of the init block created both
incrementer processes, both of which first fetched the counter,
then both incremented and stored it, losing a count.
The assertion then triggered, after which the global state is displayed.

<p>
<H3>Promela Example: Atomic Increment</H3>
<p>
It is easy to fix this example by placing the body of the incrementer
processes in an atomic blocks as follows:

<pre>
  1 proctype incrementer(byte me)
  2 {
  3   int temp;
  4 
  5   atomic {
  6     temp = counter;
  7     counter = temp + 1;
  8   }
  9   progress[me] = 1;
 10 }
</pre>

One could also have simply replaced the pair of statements with
<TT>counter = counter + 1</TT>, because Promela statements are
atomic.
Either way, running this modified model gives us an error-free traversal
of the state space:

<pre>

        invalid end states      +

<P>

Running unnecessarily large models is thus subtly discouraged, although
652MB is well within the limits of some of the more recent
desktop and laptop machines.

With this example under our belt, let's take a closer look at the
commands used to analyze Promela models and then look at more
elaborate examples.
<p>
<H3>How to Use Promela</H3>
<p>
Given a source file "qrcu.spin", one can use the following commands:

<pre>
spin -a qrcu.spin
</pre>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
        Create a file pan.c that fully searches the state machine.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<pre>
cc -DSAFETY -o pan pan.c
</pre>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
        Compile the generated state-machine search.  The "-DSAFETY"
        generates optimizations that are appropriate if you have only
        assertions (and perhaps "never" statements).  If you have
        liveness, fairness, or forward-progress checks, you may need
        to compile without "-DSAFETY".  If you leave off "-DSAFETY"
        when you could have used it, the program will let you know.
        <P>
        The optimizations produced by "-DSAFETY" greatly speed things
        up, so you should use it when you can.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<pre>
./pan
</pre>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
        This actually searches the state space.  The number of states
        can reach into the tens of millions with very small state
        machines, so you will need a machine with large memory.
        For example, qrcu.spin with 3 readers and 2 updaters required
        2.7GB of memory.
<P>
        If you aren't sure whether your machine has enough memory,
        run "top" in one window and "./pan" in another.  Keep the
        focus on the "./pan" window so that you can quickly kill
        execution if need be.  As soon as CPU time drops much below
        100%, kill "./pan".  If you have removed focus from the
        window running "./pan", you may wait a long time for the
        windowing system to grab enough memory to do anything for
        you.
<P>
        Don't forget to capture the output, especially
        if you are working on a remote machine,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<pre>
spin -t -p qrcu.spin
</pre>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
        Given "trail" file output by a run that encountered an
        error, output the sequence of steps leading to that error.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
<H3>Promela Peculiarities</H3>
<p>

Although all computer languages have underlying similarities,
Promela will provide some surprises to people used to coding in C.

<UL>
<LI>    In C, ";" terminates statements.  In Promela it separates them.
        Fortunately, more recent versions of Spin have become
        much more forgiving of "extra" semicolons.
<p>
<LI>    Promela's looping construct, the "do" statement, takes
        conditions.
        This "do" statement closely resembles a looping if-then-else
        statement.
<p>
<LI>    In C's "switch" statement, if there is no matching case, the whole
        statement is skipped.  In Promela's equivalent, confusingly called
        "if", if there is no matching guard expression, you get an error
        without a recognizable corresponding error message.
        So, if the error output indicates an innocent line of code,
        check to see if you left out a condition from an "if" or "do"
        statement.
<p>
<LI>    When creating stress tests in C, one usually races suspect operations
        against each other repeatedly.  In Promela, one instead sets up
        a single race, because Promela will search out all the possible
        outcomes from that single race. Sometimes you do need to loop
        in Promela, for example, if multiple operations overlap, but
        doing so greatly increases the size of your state space.
<p>
<LI>    In C, the easiest thing to do is to maintain a loop counter to track
        progress and terminate the loop.  In Promela, loop counters
        must be avoided like the plague because they cause the state
        space to explode.  On the other hand, there is no penalty for
        infinite loops in Promela as long as the none of the variables
        monotonically increase or decrease -- Promela will figure out
        how many passes through the loop really matter, and automatically
        prune execution beyond that point.
<p>
<LI>    In C torture-test code, it is often wise to keep per-task control
        variables.  They are cheap to read, and greatly aid in debugging the
        test code.  In Promela, per-task control variables should be used
        only when there is no other alternative.  To see this, consider
        a 5-task validation with one bit each to indicate completion.
        This gives 32 states.  In contrast, a simple counter would have
        only six states, more than a five-fold reduction.  That factor
        of five might not seem like a problem, at least not until you
        are struggling with a validation program possessing more than
        150 million states consuming more than 10GB of memory!
<p>
<LI>    One of the most challenging things both in C torture-test code and
        in Promela is formulating good assertions.  Promela also allows
        "never" claims that act sort of like an assertion replicated
        between every line of code.
<p>
<LI>    Dividing and conquering is extremely helpful in Promela in keeping
        the state space under control.  Splitting a large model into two
        roughly equal halves will result in the state space of each
        half being roughly the square root of the whole.
        For example, a million-state combined model might reduce to a
        pair of thousand-state models.
        Not only will Promela handle the two smaller models much more
        quickly with much less memory, but the two smaller algorithms
        are easier for people to understand.

<p>
<H3>Promela Coding Tricks</H3>
<p>

Promela was designed to analyze protocols, so using it on parallel programs
is a bit abusive.
The following tricks can help you to abuse Promela safely:

<UL>
<LI>    Memory reordering.  Suppose you have a pair of statements
        copying globals x and y to locals r1 and r2, where ordering
        matters (e.g., unprotected by locks), but where you have
        no memory barriers.  This can be modeled in Promela as follows:

<pre>
        if
        :: 1 -&gt; r1 = x;
                r2 = y
        :: 1 -&gt; r2 = y;
                r1 = x
        fi
</pre>

        The two branches of the "if" statement will be selected
        nondeterministically, since they both are available.
        Because the full state space is searched, <I>both</I> choices
        will eventually be made in all cases.
<P>
        Of course, this trick will cause your state space to explode
        if used too heavily.
        In addition, it requires you to anticipate possible reorderings.

<LI>    State reduction.  If you have complex assertions, evaluate
        them under "atomic".  After all, they are not part of the
        algorithm.  One example of a complex assertion (to be discussed
        in more detail later) is as follows:
<pre>
        i = 0;
        sum = 0;
        do
        :: i &lt; N_QRCU_READERS -&gt;
                sum = sum + (readerstart[i] == 1 &amp;&amp;
                             readerprogress[i] == 1);
                i++
        :: i &gt;= N_QRCU_READERS -&gt;
                assert(sum == 0);
                break
        od
</pre>

        There is no reason to evaluate this assertion
        non-atomically, since it is not actually part of the algorithm.
        Because each statement contributes to state, we can reduce
        the number of useless states by enclosing it in an "atomic"
        block as follows:
<pre>
        atomic {
                i = 0;
                sum = 0;
                do
                :: i &lt; N_QRCU_READERS -&gt;
                        sum = sum + (readerstart[i] == 1 &amp;&amp;
                                     readerprogress[i] == 1);
                        i++
                :: i &gt;= N_QRCU_READERS -&gt;
                        assert(sum == 0);
                        break
                od
        }
</pre>

<LI>    Promela does not provide functions.
        You must instead use C preprocessor macros.
        However, you must use them carefully in order to avoid
        combinatorial explosion.

</UL>

Now we are ready for more complex examples.

<p>
<H3>Promela Example: Locking</H3>
<p>

Since locks are generally useful, <TT>spin_lock()</TT> and
<TT>spin_unlock()</TT>
macros are provided in <TT>lock.h</TT>, which may be included from
multiple Promela models:

<pre>
  1 #define spin_lock(mutex) \
  2   do \
  3   :: 1 -&gt; atomic { \
  4       if \
  5       :: mutex == 0 -&gt; \
  6         mutex = 1; \
  7         break \
  8       :: else -&gt; skip \
  9       fi \
 10     } \
 11   od
 12 
 13 #define spin_unlock(mutex) \
 14   mutex = 0
</pre>

The <TT>spin_lock()</TT> macro contains an infinite do-od loop
spanning lines 2-11,
courtesy of the single guard expression of "1" on line 3.
The body of this loop is a single atomic block that contains
an if-fi statement.
The if-fi construct is similar to the do-od construct, except
that it takes a single pass rather than looping.
If the lock is not held on line 5, then line 6 acquires it and
line 7 breaks out of the enclosing do-od loop (and also exits
the atomic block).
On the other hand, if the lock is already held on line 8,
we do nothing ("skip"), and fall out of the if-fi and the
atomic block so as to take another pass through the outer
loop, repeating until the lock is available.
<P>
The <TT>spin_unlock()</TT> macro simply marks the lock as no
longer held.
<P>
Note that memory barriers are not needed because Promela assumes
full ordering.
In any given Promela state, all processes agree on both the current
state and the order of state changes that caused us to arrive at
the current state.
This is analogous to the "sequentially consistent" memory model
used by a few computer systems (such as MIPS and PA-RISC).
As noted earlier, and as will be seen in a later example,
weak memory ordering must be explicitly coded.
<P>
These macros are tested by the following Promela code:

<pre>
  1 #include "lock.h"
  2 
  3 #define N_LOCKERS 3
  4 
  5 bit mutex = 0;
  6 bit havelock[N_LOCKERS];
  7 int sum;
  8 
  9 proctype locker(byte me)
 10 {
 11   do
 12   :: 1 -&gt;
 13     spin_lock(mutex);
 14     havelock[me] = 1;
 15     havelock[me] = 0;
 16     spin_unlock(mutex)
 17   od
 18 }
 19 
 20 init {
 21   int i = 0;
 22   int j;
 23 
 24 end:  do 
 25   :: i &lt; N_LOCKERS -&gt;
 26     havelock[i] = 0;
 27     run locker(i);
 28     i++
 29   :: i &gt;= N_LOCKERS -&gt;
 30     sum = 0;
 31     j = 0;
 32     atomic {
 33       do
 34       :: j &lt; N_LOCKERS -&gt;
 35         sum = sum + havelock[j];
 36         j = j + 1
 37       :: j &gt;= N_LOCKERS -&gt;
 38         break
 39       od
 40     }
 41     assert(sum &lt;= 1);
 42     break
 43   od
 44 }
</pre>

This code is similar to that used to test the increments,
with the number of locking processes defined by the <TT>N_LOCKERS</TT>
macro definition on line 3.
The mutex itself is defined on line 5, an array to track the lock owner
on line 6, and line 7 is used by assertion
code to verify that only one process holds the lock.
<P>

The locker process is on lines 9-18, and simply loops forever
acquiring the lock on line 13, claiming it on line 14,
unclaiming it on line 15, and releasing it on line 16.
<P>

The init block on lines 20-44 initializes the current locker's
havelock array entry on line 26, starts the current locker on
line 27, and advances to the next locker on line 28.
Once all locker processes are spawned, the do-od loop
moves to line 29, which checks the assertion.
Lines 30 and 31 initialize the control variables,
lines 32-40 atomically sum the havelock array entries,
line 41 is the assertion, and line 42 exits the loop.
<P>

We can run this model by placing the above two code fragments into
files named "lock.h" and "lock.spin", respectively, and then running
the following commands:

<pre>
        spin -a lock.spin
        cc -DSAFETY -o pan pan.c
        ./pan
</pre>

The output will look something like the following:

<pre>
        (Spin Version 4.2.5 -- 2 April 2005)
                + Partial Order Reduction

        unreached in proctype :init:
                (0 of 22 states)
</pre>

As expected, this run has no assertion failures ("errors: 0").
<P>

<B>Quick Quiz 1:</B> Why is there an unreached statement in
        locker?  After all, isn't this a <I>full</I> state-space
        search???
<P>

<B>Quick Quiz 2:</B> What are some Promela code-style issues with
        this example?  In particular, why does this example have
        more states than the n=3 case for atomic increment (564 vs. 372)?

<p>
<H3>Promela Example: QRCU</H3>
<p>
This final example demonstrates a real-world use of Promela on Oleg
Nesterov's QRCU, but modified to speed up the <TT>synchronize_qrcu()</TT>
fastpath.
<P>

But first, what is QRCU?
<P>

QRCU is a variant of
<A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/202847/">SRCU</A>
(which in turn is a variant of
<A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/37889/">RCU</A>)
that trades somewhat higher read overhead
(atomic increment and decrement on a global variable) for extremely
low grace-period latencies.
If there are no readers, the grace period will be detected in less
than a microsecond, compared to the multi-millisecond grace-period
latencies of most other RCU implementations.
<OL>
<LI>    There is a <TT>qrcu_struct</TT> that defines a QRCU domain.
        Like SRCU (and unlike other variants of RCU) QRCU's action
        is not global, but instead focused on the specified
        <TT>qrcu_struct</TT>.
<LI>    There are <TT>qrcu_read_lock()</TT> and <TT>qrcu_read_unlock()</TT>
        primitives that delimit QRCU read-side critical sections.
        The corresponding <TT>qrcu_struct</TT> must be passed into
        these primitives, and the return value from <TT>rcu_read_lock()</TT>
        must be passed to <TT>rcu_read_unlock()</TT>.
        <P>
        For example:
        <P>

<pre>
        idx = qrcu_read_lock(&amp;my_qrcu_struct);
        /* read-side critical section. */
        qrcu_read_unlock(&amp;my_qrcu_struct, idx);
</pre>

<LI>    There is a <TT>synchronize_qrcu()</TT> primitive that blocks until
        all pre-existing QRCU read-side critical sections complete,
        but, like SRCU's <TT>synchronize_srcu()</TT>, QRCU's
        <TT>synchronize_qrcu()</TT> need wait only for those read-side
        critical sections that are using the same <TT>qrcu_struct</TT>.
        <P>
        For example, <TT>synchronize_qrcu(&amp;your_qrcu_struct)</TT>
        would <I>not</I> need to wait on the earlier QRCU read-side
        critical section.
        In contrast, <TT>synchronize_qrcu(&amp;my_qrcu_struct)</TT>
        <I>would</I> need to wait, since it shares the same
        <TT>qrcu_struct</TT>.
</OL>
A Linux-kernel patch for QRCU may be found
<A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/223752/">here</A>.
<P>

Returning to the Promela code for QRCU, the global variables are as follows:

<pre>
  1 #include "lock.h"
  2
  3 #define N_QRCU_READERS 2
  4 #define N_QRCU_UPDATERS 2
  5
  6 bit idx = 0;
  7 byte ctr[2];
  8 byte readerprogress[N_QRCU_READERS];
  9 bit mutex = 0;
</pre>

This example uses locking, hence including "lock.h".
Both the number of readers and writers can be varied using the
two "#define" statements, giving us not one but two ways to create
combinatorial explosion.
The "idx" variable controls which of the two elements of the "ctr"
array will be used by readers, and the "readerprogress" variable
allows the assertion to determine when all the readers are finished
(since a QRCU update cannot be permitted to complete until all
pre-existing readers have completed their QRCU read-side critical
sections).
The readerprogress array elements have values as follows,
indicating the state of the corresponding reader:
<UL>
<LI>    0: not yet started.
<LI>    1: within QRCU read-side critical section.
<LI>    2: finished with QRCU read-side critical section.
</UL>
Finally, the "mutex" variable is used to serialize updaters' slowpaths.
<P>

QRCU readers are modeled by the <TT>qrcu_reader()</TT> process shown below.

<pre>
  1 proctype qrcu_reader(byte me)
  2 {
  3   int myidx;
  4
  5   do
  6   :: 1 -&gt;
  7     myidx = idx;
  8     atomic {
  9       if
 10       :: ctr[myidx] &gt; 0 -&gt;
 11         ctr[myidx]++;
 12         break
 13       :: else -&gt; skip
 14       fi
 15     }
 16   od;
 17   readerprogress[me] = 1;
 18   readerprogress[me] = 2;
 19   atomic { ctr[myidx]-- }
 20 }
</pre>

A do-od loop spans lines 5-16, with a single guard of "1"
on line 6 that makes it an infinite loop.
Line 7 captures the current value of the global index, and lines 8-15
atomically increment it (and break from the infinite loop)
if its value was non-zero (<TT>atomic_inc_not_zero()</TT>).
Line 17 marks entry into the RCU read-side critical section, and
line 18 marks exit from this critical section, both lines for the benefit of
the <TT>assert()</TT> statement that we shall encounter later.
Line 19 atomically decrements the same counter that we incremented,
thereby exiting the RCU read-side critical section.
<P>

The following C-preprocessor macro sums the pair of counters
forcing weak memory ordering.

<pre>
  1 #define sum_unordered \
  2   atomic { \
  3     do \
  4     :: 1 -&gt; \
  5       sum = ctr[0]; \
  6       i = 1; \
  7       break \
  8     :: 1 -&gt; \
  9       sum = ctr[1]; \
 10       i = 0; \
 11       break \
 12     od; \
 13   } \
 14   sum = sum + ctr[i]
</pre>

Lines 2-13 fetch one of the counters, and line 14 fetches the other
of the pair and sums them.
The atomic block consists of a single do-od statement.
This do-od statement (spanning lines 3-12) is unusual in that
it contains two unconditional
branches with guards on lines 4 and 8, which causes Promela to
non-deterministically choose one of the two (but again, the full
state-space search causes Promela to eventually make all possible
choices in each applicable situation).
The first branch fetches the zero-th counter and sets "i" to 1 (so
that line 14 will fetch the first counter), while the second
branch does the opposite, fetching the first counter and setting "i"
to 0 (so that line 14 will fetch the second counter).
<P>
<B>Quick Quiz 3:</B> Is there a more straightforward way to code
        the do-od statement?
<P>
With the <TT>sum_unordered</TT> macro in place, we can now proceed
to the update-side process below.

<pre>
  1 proctype qrcu_updater(byte me)
  2 {
  3   int i;
  4   byte readerstart[N_QRCU_READERS];
  5   int sum;
  6
  7   do
  8   :: 1 -&gt;
  9
 10     /* Snapshot reader state. */
 11
 12     atomic {
 13       i = 0;
 14       do
 15       :: i &lt; N_QRCU_READERS -&gt;
 16         readerstart[i] = readerprogress[i];
 17         i++
 18       :: i &gt;= N_QRCU_READERS -&gt;
 19         break
 20       od
 21     }
 22
 23     sum_unordered;
 24     if
 25     :: sum &lt;= 1 -&gt; sum_unordered
 26     :: else -&gt; skip
 27     fi;
 28     if
 29     :: sum &gt; 1 -&gt;
 30       spin_lock(mutex);
 31       atomic { ctr[!idx]++ }
 32       idx = !idx;
 33       atomic { ctr[!idx]-- }
 34       do
 35       :: ctr[!idx] &gt; 0 -&gt; skip
 36       :: ctr[!idx] == 0 -&gt; break
 37       od;
 38       spin_unlock(mutex);
 39     :: else -&gt; skip
 40     fi;
 41
 42     /* Verify reader progress. */
 43
 44     atomic {
 45       i = 0;
 46       sum = 0;
 47       do
 48       :: i &lt; N_QRCU_READERS -&gt;
 49         sum = sum + (readerstart[i] == 1 &amp;&amp;
 50                readerprogress[i] == 1);
 51         i++
 52       :: i &gt;= N_QRCU_READERS -&gt;
 53         assert(sum == 0);
 54         break
 55       od
 56     }
 57   od
 58 }
</pre>

The update-side process repeats indefinitely, with the corresponding
do-od loop ranging over lines 7-57.
Each pass through the loop first snapshots the global <TT>readerprogress</TT>
array into the local <TT>readerstart</TT> array on lines 12-21.
This snapshot will be used for the assertion on line 53.
Line 23 invokes <TT>sum_unordered</TT>, and then lines 24-27
re-invoke <TT>sum_unordered</TT> if the fastpath is potentially
usable.
<P>

Lines 28-40 execute the slowpath code if need be, with
lines 30 and 38 acquiring and releasing the update-side lock,
lines 31-33 flipping the index, and lines 34-37 waiting for
all pre-existing readers to complete.
<P>
Lines 44-56 then compare the current values in the <TT>readerprogress</TT>
array to those collected in the <TT>readerstart</TT> array,
forcing an assertion failure should any readers that started before
this update still be in progress.
<P>

<B>Quick Quiz 4:</B> Why are there atomic blocks at lines 12-21
        and lines 44-56, when the operations within those atomic
        blocks have no atomic implementation on any current
        production microprocessor?
<P>

<B>Quick Quiz 5:</B> Is the re-summing of the counters on lines 24-27
        <I>really</I> necessary???
<P>

All that remains is the initialization block shown below:

<pre>
  1 init {
  2   int i;
  3 
  4   atomic {
  5     ctr[idx] = 1;
  6     ctr[!idx] = 0;
  7     i = 0;
  8     do
  9     :: i &lt; N_QRCU_READERS -&gt;
 10       readerprogress[i] = 0;
 11       run qrcu_reader(i);
 12       i++
 13     :: i &gt;= N_QRCU_READERS -&gt; break
 14     od;
 15     i = 0;
 16     do
 17     :: i &lt; N_QRCU_UPDATERS -&gt;
 18       run qrcu_updater(i);
 19       i++
 20     :: i &gt;= N_QRCU_UPDATERS -&gt; break
 21     od
 22   }
 23 }
</pre>

This block simply initializes the counter pair on lines 5-6,
spawns the reader processes on lines 7-14, and spawns the updater
processes on lines 15-21.
This is all done within an atomic block to reduce state space.

<H3>Running the QRCU Example</H3>
<p>
To run the QRCU example, combine the code fragments in the previous
section into a single file named "qrcu.spin", and place the definitions
for <TT>spin_lock()</TT> and <TT>spin_unlock()</TT> into a file named
"lock.h".
Then use the following commands to build and run the QRCU model:
<pre>
        spin -a qrcu.spin
        cc -DSAFETY -o pan pan.c
        ./pan
</pre>
The resulting output shows that this model passes all of the cases
shown in this table:

<P>

Now, it would be nice to run the case with three readers and three
updaters, however, simple extrapolation indicates that this will
require on the order of a terabyte of memory best case.
So, what to do?
Here are some possible approaches:
<OL>
<LI>    See whether a smaller number of readers and updaters suffice
        to prove the general case.
<LI>    Manually construct a proof of correctness.
<LI>    Use a more capable tool.
<LI>    Divide and conquer.
</OL>
<P>
The following sections discuss each of these approaches.
<p>
<H3>How Many Readers and Updaters Are Really Needed?</H3>
<p>
One approach is to look carefully at the Promela code for
<TT>qrcu_updater()</TT> and notice that the only global state
change is happening under the lock.
Therefore, only one updater at a time can possibly be modifying
state visible to either readers or other updaters.
This means that any sequences of state changes can be carried
out serially by a single updater due to the fact that Promela does a full
state-space search.
Therefore, at most two updaters are required: one to change state
and a second to become confused.
<P>

The situation with the readers is less clear-cut, as each reader
does only a single read-side critical section then terminates.
It is possible to argue that the useful number of readers is limited,
due to the fact that the fastpath must see at most a zero and a one
in the counters.
This is a fruitful avenue of investigation, in fact, it leads to
the full proof of correctness described in the next section.
<p>
<H3>Proof of Correctness</H3>
<p>
The
<A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/223752/">proof</A>
is as follows:

<OL>
<LI>    For <TT>synchronize_qrcu()</TT> to exit too early, then
        by definition there must have been at least one reader
        present during <TT>synchronize_qrcu()</TT>'s full
        execution.
<p>
<LI>    The counter corresponding to this reader will have been
        at least 1 during this time interval.
<p>
<LI>    The <TT>synchronize_qrcu()</TT> code forces at least one
        of the counters to be at least 1 at all times.
<p>
<LI>    Therefore, at any given point in time, either one of the
        counters will be at least 2, or both of the counters will
        be at least one.
<p>
<LI>    However, the <TT>synchronize_qrcu()</TT> fastpath code
        can read only one of the counters at a given time.
        It is therefore possible for the fastpath code to fetch
        the first counter while zero, but to race with a counter
        flip so that the second counter is seen as one.
<p>
<LI>    There can be at most one reader persisting through such
        a race condition, as otherwise the sum would be two or
        greater, which would cause the updater to take the slowpath.
<p>
<LI>    But if the race occurs on the fastpath's first read of the
        counters, and then again on its second read, there have
        to have been two counter flips.
<p>
<LI>    Because a given updater flips the counter only once, and
        because the update-side lock prevents a pair of updaters
        from concurrently flipping the counters, the only way that
        the fastpath code can race with a flip twice is if the
        first updater completes.
<p>
<LI>    But the first updater will not complete until after all
        pre-existing readers have completed.
<p>
<LI>    Therefore, if the fastpath races with a counter flip
        twice in succession, all pre-existing readers must have
        completed, so that it is safe to take the fastpath.
</OL>

Of course, not all parallel algorithms have such simple proofs.
In such cases, it may be necessary to enlist more capable tools.

<p>
<H3>More Capable Tools</H3>
<p>
Although Promela and Spin are quite useful,
much more capable tools are available, particularly for validating
hardware.
This means that if it is possible to translate your algorithm
to the hardware-design VHDL language, as it often will be for
low-level parallel algorithms, then it is possible to apply these
tools to your code (for example, this was done for the first
realtime RCU algorithm).
However, such tools can be quite expensive.
<P>

Although the advent of commodity multiprocessing
might eventually result in powerful free-software model-checkers
featuring fancy state-space-reduction capabilities,
this does not help much in the here and now.
<P>

As an aside, there are Spin features that support approximate searches
that require fixed amounts of memory, however, I have never been able
to bring myself to trust approximations when validating parallel
algorithms.
<P>

Another approach might be to divide and conquer.
<p>
<H3>Divide and Conquer</H3>
<p>
It is often possible to break down a larger parallel algorithm into
smaller pieces, which can then be proven separately.
For example, a 10-billion-state model might be broken into a pair
of 100,000-state models.
Taking this approach not only makes it easier for tools such as
Promela to validate your algorithms, it can also make your algorithms
easier to understand.
<p>
<H3>Summary</H3>
<p>
Promela is a very powerful tool for validating small parallel algorithms.
It is a useful tool in the parallel kernel hacker's toolbox, but
it should not be the only tool.
The QRCU experience is a case in point: given the Promela validation,
the proof of correctness, and several
<A HREF="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;hb=HEAD;f=Documentation/RCU/torture.txt">rcutorture</A>
runs, I now feel
reasonably confident in the QRCU algorithm and its implementation.
But I would certainly not feel so confident given only one of the three!

    Excellent point!!!  I always like to see how close to the edge I can push the system, but your suggested use of ulimit is well taken.<br>
